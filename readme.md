## Hooks:
In Lecture 02, we learned about "hooks" in React.  React Hooks are a powerful feature introduced in React version 16.8. They allow you to use various React features within functional components without the need for class components. Each React Hook name is prefixed with the word â€œuse". 

### useState:
useState is a React Hook that lets you add a state variable to your component. 
const [state, setState] = useState(initialState)
