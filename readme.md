  ### Topics Covered:
  - Basics of React
  - Setting up a React project using Vite
  - Introduction to props and components.

  ## Props:
  In React, "props" (short for properties) are a fundamental concept used for passing data from one component to another. Props are read-only and help create dynamic and interactive React applications by allowing components to communicate and share data.

  ### Topics Covered:
  - Hooks in React
  - useState
  - useEffect

  ## Hooks:
  In Lecture 02, we learned about "hooks" in React. React Hooks are a powerful feature introduced in React version 16.8. They allow you to use various React features within functional components without the need for class components. Each React Hook name is prefixed with the word â€œuse".

  
  ### useState:
  useState is a React Hook that lets you add a state variable to your component. 
  
  ```javascript
  const [state, setState] = useState(initialState);
  ```

  ### Topics Covered:
  - useEffect

  ## useEffect:
  useEffect helps us do things in our components when something changes. 
  For example, if we want to show a message when a button is clicked, we can use useEffect. 

  It's like saying, "Hey React, do this when something happens!".

  ### Topics Covered:
  - useRef

  ## useRef:
  useRef is a hook in React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. This hook is used to create a mutable reference that persists across renders of a component.

  It's commonly used for accessing or storing a reference to a DOM element or a value that needs to persist between renders without causing re-renders.

  ### Topics Covered:
  - Conditional rendering
  - Render list using map()

  ## Conditional Rendering:
  - Conditional rendering in React allows components to render different output based on certain conditions.
  - This can be achieved using conditional statements such as if or ternary operators within the JSX code.

  ### Topics Covered:
  - Fetch API in React
  - Handling Responses: Processing the response using response.json() to extract JSON data.
  - Updating State: Storing the fetched data in state variables using React's useState hook.
  - Rendering Data: Dynamically rendering the fetched data in the user interface using map().

  ### Topics Covered:
  - Event Handling
  - Handling Form (use spread operator)

  ```javascript
  const onClickHandler = () => {
      setMyDetail({ ...myDetail, myname: "Sam" });
      // ...myDetail =  The triple dots are known as the spread operator, which takes an iterable (array, string, or object) and expands the iterable to individual values.
  };
  ```

  ### Topics Covered:
  - React Router
  - useLocation: Provides information about the current URL, pathname, and query parameters.
  - Outlet: Renders nested route content in a parent route component.
  - useParams: For Dynamic routing, we use the useParams hook, which is used to handle URLs with variable segments, such as product IDs in e-commerce applications.

  ### Topics Covered:
  - Prop drilling: Prop drilling is basically a situation when the same data is being sent at almost every level due to requirements in the final level. 

  - useContext hook: It can be used together with the useState Hook to share state between deeply nested components more easily than with useState alone.

  ### Create a Counter using Redux Toolkit
  
  ### Topics Covered:
  - **Redux Toolkit**: Redux Toolkit is an official, recommended library that provides a set of tools to simplify the use of Redux for managing application state. It helps reduce boilerplate code, simplifies the setup process, and includes utilities for common tasks like creating reducers, handling asynchronous logic, and configuring the Redux store.

  - **Store**: The Redux store is a centralized place to manage the global state of your application. It holds the entire state tree of your app and allows you to dispatch actions to change this state.

  
  ### configureStore:
  ```javascript
  import { configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';
  import counterReducer from './counterSlice';

  const store = configureStore({
    reducer: {
      counter: counterReducer,
    },
  });

  export default store;
  ```
  - **Reducer**: A reducer is a function that determines how the state of your application changes in response to an action. In Redux Toolkit, reducers are often defined within slices using createSlice. 

  - **Slice**: A slice is a collection of Redux reducer logic and actions for a specific feature of your application. Redux Toolkit's createSlice function allows you to define a slice, which includes the state, reducers, and action creators.

  ```javascript
  import { createSlice } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';

  const counterSlice = createSlice({
    name: 'counter',
    initialState: { value: 0 },
    reducers: {
      increment: (state) => {
        state.value += 1;
      },
      decrement: (state) => {
        state.value -= 1;
      },
    },
  });

  export const { increment, decrement } = counterSlice.actions;
  export default counterSlice.reducer;
  ```

  - **useSelector**: useSelector is a hook provided by React-Redux that allows you to extract data from the Redux store state. It takes a selector function as an argument, which is used to select a piece of state from the store.

  - **useDispatch**: useDispatch is a hook that gives you access to the dispatch function from the Redux store. It allows you to send actions to the Redux store, which can then update the state.

  ```javascript
  // Import necessary dependencies
  import './App.css'
  import { useDispatch, useSelector } from 'react-redux'
  import { decrement, increment } from './redux/counter/counterSlice'
  import { Link } from 'react-router-dom'
  import Navbar from './component/Navbar'

  function App() {
    // useSelector: Extracts the current count value from the Redux store
    const count = useSelector((state) => state.counter.value)

    // useDispatch: Returns the dispatch function to send actions to the Redux store
    const dispatch = useDispatch()

    return (
      <>
        <Link to={'/navbar'}>Navbar</Link>
        
        {/* Display the current count */}
        <h1>count is {count}</h1>
        
        {/* Button to increment the count */}
        <button onClick={() => dispatch(increment())}>increment</button>

        {/* Button to decrement the count (optional) */}
        <button onClick={() => dispatch(decrement())}>decrement</button>
      </>
    )
  }

  export default App
  ```
</details>
